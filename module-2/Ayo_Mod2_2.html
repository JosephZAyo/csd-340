        <h2>Introduction to Ayo</h2>

        <!-- Paragraph 1: Introduction to Ayo -->
        <p class="intro">I was born and raised in California, and moved out to Arizona when I was coming of age. I've been here ever since, and now I study software development at Bellevue University. </p>

        <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
        <p>Aside from tech, I love to watch movies, game online, bowl, golf, and run. These are my main hobbies, but I'm also very open to trying new ones.</p>

        <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
        <p>My family is very important to me. I have two siblings, and we are all close. Hanging out with them is one of my favorite things to do, even to this day. </p>

        <!-- Paragraph 4-->
        <p>One of my personal goals is to hit Ascendant in a game called Valorant. It may sound unusual, but I have a high competitive drive, and only the top 4% of players can make it into the Ascendant ranking. It's quite prestigious for a video game.</p>
